# Minesweeper Game
This GitHub project is developed to implement a classic Minesweeper game. The game screen consists of small boxes, some of which are empty, some contain bombs, and some contain numbers. The numbers indicate how many bombs are adjacent to a particular box.

# Features
Menu: The main menu of the game, which includes various options.
New Game: Use this option to start a new game. Before starting, you will be prompted to enter a username. If no username is entered, a player character named "DEFAULT" will be created by default.
Scoreboard: This option is used to display the highest scores of the players.
Exit: Use this option to exit the game.
Difficulty Levels
The difficulty levels of the game affect both the number of randomly placed mines in the game and the size of the game board. As the difficulty level increases, you will encounter more bombs and a larger game area.

# How to Play

Select the "New Game" option to start a new game.
Optionally, enter a username. If not provided, a player character named "DEFAULT" will be created by default.
When the game screen opens, you will see a field consisting of small boxes. Each box can contain either empty space, a bomb, or a number.
Your goal is to open all the empty boxes without detonating any bombs.
Click on the boxes to open them. If you open a box with a bomb, you lose the game.
The numbers indicate the number of bombs adjacent to each box. You can use these numbers to deduce the positions of the bombs.
When you have opened all the empty boxes, you win the game.
